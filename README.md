Portfolio Reflection: DriverPass Project
The DriverPass project involved developing a system for a client who had an interest in improving how students prepare for driving examinations. The client, DriverPass, being a company, needed a system where students could sign up for accounts, schedule driving lessons, and take online practice tests to allow them to pass both the written and behind-the-wheel examinations. They wanted to create an efficient system that was easy to use and could manage the students and lecturers effectively.
One thing that I excelled at was creating good and understandable documentation of the system design and client's requirements. I made sure to lay out both the business requirements document and system design document in a manner that any stakeholder or developer could easily discern the purpose, features, and flow of the system. I also made sure to keep the UML diagrams logical to trace and visually represent the process from both the user and system sides.
If I could redo a part of my work, I would enhance the system design document with more detailed descriptions of data handling and security protocols. While the process flows and diagrams were accurate, including more in the security section would make the document more realistic and complete, especially since data privacy is essential in systems that handle sensitive information like student records and payment details.
In trying to understand the user's needs, I read the scenario laid out by the client and sought to develop system functionalities that addressed their main goals: scheduling ease, accessibility, and usability. Considering the user's needs is important because a system is only successful if it is able to solve real problems for those using it. An intuitive system that works the way users expect it to will be more effective, easier to roll out, and more likely to achieve the client's business goals.
For designing software, I address the process methodically by breaking it down into stages such as requirements gathering, diagramming, validation with stakeholders, and iteration based on feedback. I employ techniques such as use case analysis, activity diagrams, and user flow mapping to visualize how the user interacts with the system. In the future, I will incorporate more agile design methods, including early prototyping and user testing, to prove the design in the context of user needs before full implementation.
